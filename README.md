# R8: Yet Another CHIP-8 Emulator in Rust ðŸ˜‰

R8 is a CHIP-8 emulator written in Rust, using [sdl2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [egui](https://www.egui.rs/). With an small GUI for debugging and loading roms with drag and drop.

## What is CHIP-8?

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language that was used to create games for some home computers in the 1970s and 1980s. It has a simple instruction set and graphics system, and it can run on various platforms with minimal changes.

## Current state

- All opcodes are implemented
- The display works
- The keyboard works
- The timers work
- The sound works
- The debugger works
- The GUI works
- The roms drag and drop works

## Possible improvements

- Add a menu to load roms (drag and drop is not very user friendly)
- Add a menu to change the speed of the emulator (by default it runs at 60Hz)
- Add a Wasm version
- Add a disassembler and a assembler
