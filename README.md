# R8: Yet Another CHIP-8 Emulator in Rust ðŸ˜‰

R8 is a **WIP** CHIP-8 emulator written in Rust, using sdl2 and egui. It is mostly functional, but it still lacks sound and debugging interface, and a better way to load the roms. For now, you can load the roms by dragging and dropping them to the emulator window. It also has some strange behaviors that I am checking.

## What is CHIP-8?

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language that was used to create games for some home computers in the 1970s and 1980s. It has a simple instruction set and graphics system, and it can run on various platforms with minimal changes.
